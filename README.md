# Zen Postbox

This is a Friendica add-on that adds a Jot Plugin tool button to the Compose editor allowing users to easily select any of the "Postbox" color backgrounds.

Postbox color backgrounds are similar to a Facebook feature for text-only posts, except Friendica's allows any arbitrary content and users may have more than on Postbox per post. Support for Postbox is built into the Bookface 1.6+ scheme for Frio, but this addon will enable it regardless of what theme/scheme is being used.

This add-on also adds support for displaying Postbox content in all feeds no matter what theeme is in use.

_**Note**: It has "zen" on the beginning of the name just to make the add-on load AFTER other Jot Plugins. In particular the "Smileybutton" add-on which has a typo that clears any Jot Plugins that load before it._

## Getting started

1. Place the "zen_postbox" folder in your _friendica/addons_ subfolder.
2. Go to the Main _Menu > Admin > Addons_ and enable "Zen Postbox"
3. On the Compose Modal or Compose Page you should see a rainbox button that opens a background selector.

## Using Zen Postbox

1. Open the message Compose modal or Page
2. To wrap text, etc., in a Postbox select it in the message editor.
3. Press the rainbow button at the bottom of the editor.
4. Select which Postbox background you'd like to wrap the text in.
5. Press the "Preview" tab to see what it will look like.

If no text is selected in the editor a Postbox will be appeneded to the text area with "..." for content. Replace the "..." with your text, etc.

## Known Issues

- Postboxes are not shown on other platforms when your post is shared.
- Postboxes are not shown in third-party apps (at least none do yet)
